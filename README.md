# Project Title: Racket Weather

### Statement
Our project's goal is to take weather data from  [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/) and create two different visualizations using this data.

### Analysis
We will use the various APIs and Racket libraries that we explored in FP1 and FP2. The weather API is called  [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/). 

The various Racket libraries are as follows:

1. [net/url](https://docs.racket-lang.org/net/url.html)
2. [json](https://docs.racket-lang.org/json/)
3. [racket turtle](https://docs.racket-lang.org/racket_turtle/index.html)
4. [racket/draw](https://docs.racket-lang.org/draw/index.html)
5. [racket graph](https://stchang.github.io/graph/graph.html)

### Data set or other source materials
We will be using Weather data from [OpenWeatherMap](http://openweathermap.org/). This data will be downloaded using HTTP GET requests using the net/url library, and stored in Racket as JSON data. This portion was already explored in [Jason's](https://github.com/JasonD94) [FP1](https://github.com/JasonD94/FP1).

### Deliverable and Demonstration
There will be some sort of visualization (Map, Graph, Chart etc) in two separate programs that Huy and JT will create. These programs will utilize Jason's Racket program which will gather the data.

### Evaluation of Results
If a we can get JSON data, and plot it on a map, we're happy.

Yep, we have permission as seen in this [FP3 pull request.](https://github.com/oplS16projects/FP3/pull/12)

### JT Shepple @JohnShep
will write the....

### Huy Huynh @HuyH0114
will work on...

### Jason Downing @JasonD94
Jason is team lead. Additionally, Jason will work on the weather data program. Also, he knows Git so he'll deal with git stuff.
